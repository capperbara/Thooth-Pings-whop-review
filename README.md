### Transparent Record Keeping

  

One thing I appreciate about Thooth Pings is their commitment to transparency.

**Their tracking includes:**

This level of transparency is rare in the sports betting picks industry.

Thooth Pings operates on a weekly subscription model starting at **$14.99 per week**.

Discounts are available on the monthly and annual subscription. If you opt to pay monthly, the cost is **$39.99/month**, or annually it's **$349.99/year**.

  

This pricing puts them in the affordable range compared to premium handicapping services that can cost $100+ per week.

## Sports Betting Legality and Important Considerations

  

Before joining any betting service, you need to understand the legal landscape.

  

In the United States, sports betting was largely illegal under the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) until 2018.

  

The Supreme Court struck down PASPA in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, allowing individual states to legalize sports betting.

  

**Current Legal Status (as of 2024):**

-   **37 states plus Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico** have operational legalized sports betting
-   **30 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico** allow online sports betting
-   **8 states** only permit betting through physical sportsbooks
-   **North Carolina** has legalized but operations haven't started yet

  

Since the 2018 Supreme Court decision, over $20 billion has been spent on sports betting in the United States.

  

**Before you start betting:**

-   Check your local and state laws
-   Only use licensed, regulated sportsbooks
-   Understand tax implications of winnings
-   Be aware of any restrictions in your jurisdiction
